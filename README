BugReport
====================

BugReport allows the user to manually generate a bugreport to the SD Card or
internal memory.  It can then be offloaded from the device via email or
upload to a server for direct submission to a bug-tracking system.

BugReport consists of a Java app (PanicReport.apk) and a native service qk-bugreport.
It requires a service definition in the device's init file (init.<device>.rc),
which specifies they keycodes used for the Magic Key Press trigger.
